# âš¡ EV Charging Demand Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to forecast electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using machine learning models. It was developed as part of the AICTE Internship program in July 2025.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

As EV adoption increases, predicting when and where demand for charging stations will rise is critical for infrastructure planning. This project analyzes historical EV data and builds a machine learning model to estimate future charging demand.
